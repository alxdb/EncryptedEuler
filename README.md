# EncryptedEuler
Encrypted solutions to Euler Project problems. Solutions are encrytped with their answers.

Files are encrypted with openssl aes-128-cbc.
To decrypt, put a file called answers.txt in the top level directory with the answer for each problem on its respective line.
Or just decrypt normally with the answer as the passphrase.

Runing the encrypt script will delete the original source so make backups!
